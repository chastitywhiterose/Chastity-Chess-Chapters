# Chastity's Queen's Gambit Opening Book

## The Reference that was too big for the other book!


# Chapter 0: Introduction

This is the start of a new Chess book devoted to the Queen's Gambit. Like the last book, it will be a series of blog posts, usually with some pictures to help you visualize it.

This book will guide you through some of my most tested positions when playing Chess with the Queen's Gambit. While this may include some material from my first Chess book, [Chastity's Chess
Chapters](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/chastitys-chess-chapters/), it will expand further beyond what I had space to include because the paperback was already at 100 pages. To reduce the number of pages and the printing cost, I will be reducing the size of some of the included images.

Like the first book, I want the pictures to be a visual guide for people who have not mastered Chess notation yet. The failure of many Chess books is that they are full of notation and it is hard to follow unless you are literally sitting at a Chessboard or using Chess software to follow along. While you should be doing this for the best experience, I have a photographic memory and I find that without a picture, I won't really remember what I learned. The visual learners will get the best benefit out of this book.

## The Queen's Gambit Accepted

The Queen's Gambit sounds like a fancy name, and this name was used for a Netflix show as well. However, this opening was well known before people had televisions, computers, or the internet. The word "gambit" means sacrifice. In this opening white sacrifices a pawn with the hope of getting an advantage later. To some people, it also means a gamble because there is no way of knowing if it will work out the way you want depending on what your opponent does.

The opening starts with each side moving the pawn in front of their queen.
Then white moves the pawn on c2 to c4.

In this position, black's pawn can capture the white pawn and yet it doesn't appear that white can capture it back, at least not yet. If it does take the pawn, this is known as accepting the gambit. New players will more likely than not take this pawn if they don't see the trap.

![d4-d5-c4.png](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/d4-d5-c4.png?w=360)	![d4-d5-c4-dxc4](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/d4-d5-c4-dxc4-1.png?w=360)![d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4.png](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4.png?w=360)

You see, the idea was to distract the pawn and move it away from the center so that white's king pawn could move two squares forward. Also notice that the white bishop on f1 could also capture the black pawn on c4 next turn, but not so fast, first, black has to choose their next move. The only problem is that there really is no good way for black to stop white from taking their pawn with the bishop. If they try to protect it with another pawn, things can turn out badly. Sooner or later white will capture back the c4 pawn with the bishop and if black tries to stop it, they will only lose more pieces.

My best advice is that if you accept the Queen's Gambit, also accept that you will lose this pawn and don't try to defend it by moving the b7 pawn to b5. This has never worked out well for my opponents. 

All white has to do is move a pawn to a4 to attack the b5 pawn. The goal is to remove it from defending the c4 black pawn. White's bishop wants to go there to attack the f7 square.

If you are black, do not let the sequence of the following images happen to you!

![d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4-b5.png](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/d4-d5-c4-e4-b5.png?w=360)	![d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4-b5-a4.png](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4-b5-a4.png?w=360)	![d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4-b5-a4-a6.png](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4-b5-a4-a6.png?w=360)	![d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4-b5-a4-a6-xb5.png](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4-b5-a4-a6-axb5.png?w=360)	![d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4-b5-a4-a6-axb5-axb5.png](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4-b5-a4-a6-axb5-axb5.png?w=360)	![d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4-b5-a4-a6-axb5-axb5-Ra8.png](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/d4-d5-c4-dxc4-e4-b5-a4-a6-axb5-axb5-ra8.png?w=360)

I also want you to notice that the previous sequence of moves would still be just as bad if white had decided to move their king's pawn only one space to e3. There are valid reasons they might do so to add extra protection to the d4 pawn. The d4 pawn is only protected by the queen right now so beware of this in all your games.

In the Queen's Gambit Accepted, I prefer to move the king's pawn to e3 because of a really awesome trap that has caused me to win a lot of games. Black's most common way of protecting the c4 pawn is with pawn to b5. This never works well for black. And in this case, there is a 100% chance of black either losing a rook or a knight.

Let me show you what happens in if white moves pawn to e3 instead of e4 after black defends the c4 pawn with b5.

If you are the black player, I would recommend against accepting the Queen's Gambit entirely. It leads to many traps by white. If you do accept it, you will lose your pawn anyway. Don't waste time with that and instead move out other pawns depending on what pieces you plan to move. Below are the two most common responses to the Queen's Gambit. The following is my written recommendations black should play instead.

## 1. d4 d5 2. c4

## ! Good Moves for Black

- e6 Defend the d5 pawn by moving the king's pawn to e6. If white decides to capture the d5 pawn black will capture back and then white will still not be able to move their bishop to c4. Playing e6 is called the "Queen's Gambit Declined". This is the best move in my opinion because moving this pawn there prevents diagonal attacks on the f7 square even if white does manage to get their bishop or queen lined up there.

- c6 Although it is less common, c6, known as the "Slav Defense" is another way to decline the gambit. By playing this move, black is hinting at a possible check against the white king by moving the black queen to a5. In any case, this move has the same idea that black will capture back on d5 if white's c4 pawn takes it. It isn't bad but 

## ? Bad Moves for Black

- dxc4 If black takes this pawn, they can fall into one of many possible traps. It is nearly impossible to prevent white from taking back this pawn with the bishop after moving the e pawn. Also, white now has the option to safely move the e pawn to e4 without it being captured because black no longer has the pawn on d5. If black has played dxc4 here, then they are now in a "Queen's Gambit Accepted" position. White has the advantage of controlling the center with both their king and queen pawns. Black can still win of course but it will be much harder from here.

## Queen's Gambit Declined

![d4-d5-c4-e6.png](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/d4-d5-c4-e6.png)

## 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6

If black declines the Queen's Gambit with e6, there are some things white must look out for. First, by moving the e pawn, black allows their dark squared bishop to get out next turn. This can possibly put the king in check and/or pin the knight if it has moved to c3. Therefore, all evaluation of moves should consider this threat.

## ! Good Moves for White

- c5 By advancing the c4 pawn to c5, black is prevented from getting their dark squared bishop out entirely. I recommend this as the best move because now both of black's bishops are prevented from getting out. They already blocked their light squared bishop on e6 and now our c5 pawn prevents them from moving the dark squared bishop there unless they are prepared to get killed by the d4 pawn in response.

- a3 is not the most offensive move but it is a nice defensive measure to prevent the dark squared bishop from coming to b4. This move should be done if white wants to safely move their knight to c3.

- Nf3 Moving the knight to f3 is particularly good in the Queen's Gambit Declined position because it is safe here and can possibly move to e5 next turn. It also means we have not committed to whether we will move the e pawn one or two squares.

## ? Bad Moves for White

- Nc3 Whatever you do, don't try moving the knight to c3 on this turn unless you are prepared to lose it! You can move it here later if you wish but not until you have dealt with the threat of black's dark squared bishop first. There will be some people who disagree with me on this because they think losing a knight to take down a bishop is a fair trade. However, I protect my knights because they are my "Queen Killers" and are often involved in forks later in the end game that my opponents don't see. If you move the knight to c3 here, the bishop can move to b4 and the knight can't move because that would put the king in check.

## Slav Defense

![d4-d5-c4-c6.png](https://chastitychesschallenge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/d4-d5-c4-c6.png)


## 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6

I must admit that I have not studied the Slav Defense as much as I have the Queen's Gambit Declined or Queen's Gambit Accepted. However, I do have two recommendations for white moves here.

- Nf3 is a solid move because the knight will certainly be involve in the game at some point and is not under immediate threat.
- Bf4 is a good idea here because we can target the knight on b8 now that the c pawn is not in the way. We have a lot of options for where the bishop can go from here. It is a safe move at this point with no real downsides. Don't hesitate to kill the knight with the bishop unless you are player who prefers to keep your bishops alive. There is some matter of preference when it comes to the value of knights vs bishops.

As I play more games in the Slav defense, I may have more to say here. The Slav Defense has its own merits even though it is not as popular as other responses to the Queen's Gambit.
