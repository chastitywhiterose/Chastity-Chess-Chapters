The files here were translated from the original text with [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/). Making translations like this was inspired by my friend Norma who speaks Spanish but has taught me the reliability of using Google Translate to communicate across a language barrier.

Because I know only English, I cannot verify if the translation is accurate in all parts of the book, but with proper feedback from those people who know these languages natively, I hope to find out if this works as I intended.
