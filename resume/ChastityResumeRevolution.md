# Chastity's Resume Revolution


# Introduction

One of the most valuable things I learned during my portfolio classes was the fact that resumes are required to be read by Artificial Intelligence before some of them are passed to an actual employer who may hire a person for the job.

The implications of this are both negative and positive. On the one hand, it makes writing a good resume harder because it must be able to be read by a machine easily, but at the same time look good to an actual human. However, the addition of AI into the mix also means that there is theoretically an objective method by which a resume can be judged.

I know that a resume is written for an employer to be able to read quickly because when they are reading hundreds of resumes, it is quite time-consuming to read them if they are too long. For the highest chances of obtaining a job, the applicant must have a resume of one or two pages.

However, I also know that this system can lead to problems. First of all, if a resume is short, then certainly many details are left out. There is no way that one bullet point on my list of work history could explain everything I did in my over ten years at Hy-Vee. The information is also useless to someone who has neither shopped nor worked at the Hy-Vee grocery store.

Similarly, many companies would expect the applicant to have experience in Microsoft Word, but what they wouldn't know is that LibreOffice Writer could serve the same purposes as Microsoft Word and get the job done. Therefore, Free and Open-Source software experience will get overlooked by many employers who lack the education to know what they are reading on a resume.

I am a Technical Writer. My best genre of writing is when I am writing about how to do something. I might be writing about how to play a game, use some kind of software tool, or the steps involved in publishing a book.

## Career Goals:

In 2023, I made the move to continue my education and go into the entirely new fields of writing and teaching Chess. It was a Chess Journalist by the name of Tarjei J. Svensen who gave me the idea to combine writing with my love of the game of Chess. I especially take notice of news related to LGBTQIA issues and Gender Inequality in the world of competitive Chess.

But as good as I am at playing and teaching Chess, I seem to be even better at using free and Open-Source software to create high-quality PDF and EPUB files, which can be printed or viewed on any digital screen. My dream is also to help other people publish their books. I also have a special interest in writing about software and how to use it. This kind of Technical Writing can apply to anything I have knowledge and experience with.

My best role for a company would be where I am writing tutorials or documentation for how a product or service should be used. Writing of technical details could be anything from the very fun (how to play a video game), to the very boring and serious (how to take a medication and list all the possible side effects to watch for).

Being a Technical Writer is general-purpose enough that it can apply to anything. I will prove this point by explaining each of my previous jobs and their possible relevance to my future as a writer.

# Hy-Vee

My first job was with Hy-Vee. I was a Courtesy Clerk, which is a fancy term for someone who sacks groceries, helps customers load their car, and brings in the carts. 

Over time, I moved into stocking the Health Market and other departments, where I helped many customers find things because I was one of the few people they saw to even ask for help.

But the job I am most proud of was my role as a Floral Clerk. I was trained in watering the plants the correct amount, writing customer orders over the phone or in person, acting as a cashier at the register, and getting orders ready for delivery.

When taking Floral orders, every detail mattered. We had to know who we were delivering to, their address, phone number, and instructions for what to do if they were not home to answer the door. 

We also had to know what was being delivered, if it was not hand-picked by the customer from what we already had pre-made. Many times, customers would come in to order flowers for a funeral or a wedding. I would show them pictures from the books we had and then copy them with the copy machine in the store and write down the product numbers on the example arrangements from the book. The manager and designers would sometimes have to establish the final cost at a later time when they were in.

I frequently closed the shop and was the only employee there in the evenings. I wrote down all orders, answered every phone call possible, and made plenty of arrangements myself in front of customers, and met their satisfaction when they wanted to give flowers to their friends, mother, wife, or girlfriend.

I was very good at this position, but was forced to leave because Hy-Vee refused to allow me to move up to a full-time position. They said I had no skills or qualifications for anything. My customers and former co-workers would disagree. I could not make a living on 16 hours a week, and so I resigned permanently in July of 2023.

# Brillient

Brillient is a government contract company that manages various things for federal agencies.

In my role as a General Clerk, I was responsible for sorting, scanning, and shelving hundreds of files per day that came into the National Records Center. It was not my job to know what the files were about. My department's job was to keep track of the files and store them with both digital and paper documentation. Because of my technical skills, I was briefly placed as temporary General Clerk 2 during the COVID pandemic when we had to limit the number of people in the building. I reported to my supervisor by email and phone while she was absent. I learned how to use the database of the Department of Homeland Security to identify where a file was and locate it when it was requested. Managing 17 million files in that facility alone was an incredible task.

Due to the sensitive nature of the documents, a government clearance is required for this position. The government and my supervisor trusted me, but an unfortunate knee injury left me unable to perform my duties, and I was given the choice to either be fired or resign. I then resigned and spent months regaining the ability to walk.

I also worked at Hy-Vee on and off during some of the time I was at this job. After it ended, I went back to working regularly at Hy-Vee in Independence until transferring back to my original Lees Summit # Hy-Vee, where I first started.

# Gamestop

Besides working at Hy-Vee, I also started working part-time at GameStop in 2022. I was cleaning the shop and helping customers find the video games they were looking for. I enjoyed this job a lot, and it felt more like play than work. I never worked enough hours to make a significant amount of money, but I enjoyed it until I became too busy with Walmart later on.

# Walmart

My job with Walmart started in September of 2023. Of the many places I applied to after leaving Hy-Vee, Walmart gave me the job of Overnight Stocker because it was the biggest need at the time. My experience with Hy-Vee served me well, but I found this job much easier than my time as a Hy-Vee Floral clerk because I was part of a team rather than being left alone with all the responsibility I had in the Floral Department.

Stocking all the products overnight at Walmart is a very physical job. Pulling heavy pallets and lifting heavy boxes in some departments is often more than what my limited strength allows. However, I have done well in this job because I show up more reliably than many others who don't show up to work. We are eternally understaffed because people don't usually stay as long as I have.

Working the overnight shift is something many people find difficult because working all night and then sleeping during the day does not allow for having a family or social life. However, my lack of friends, self-motivated personality, and strategy allow me to get work done even if I have to come in early or stay late to cover for work that others did not show up to complete.

My job at Walmart doesn't involve any writing other than texting my team leads and coaches questions or reports on what I have gotten done so far. However, I have worked this job while I was also attending online school in my Full Sail University Creative Writing program. I consider my job with Walmart to be useful for keeping my body active while my mind is busy with my other responsibilities for my planned writing career.

I often wonder if there are any roles involving writing or technology that I could obtain at Walmart. My current job as an overnight stocker is nice, but it does not use my computer skills or the detailed writing that is enhanced by my autistic brain.
