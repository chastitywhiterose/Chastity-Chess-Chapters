Jacqueline Candelaria:

"Great job on the resume! I appreciate you using the VMock resource.

The only suggested edit I have it to not use your name and personal pronoun in the professional summary. Here is a suggested edit: Writer with a focus on making Chess accessible to low-income citizens through free and open source software. Teach Chess through the use of videos, graphic design and computer software.

When applying for a specific job, make sure the professional summary includes relevant experience related to that job along with key words."
