# Chastity's Markdown Chess Database

## Chess is a tree with infinite branches

This database is my personal project where every single move that takes place is the name of a folder. In each folder is another readme.md file which has my notes on that position and what I recommend.

This project will probably go on for the rest of my life because it is never ending. This is just the start but it has potential to become content in my book. The idea is that I write notes on each position and give the names of openings for education of my Chess students. If the information is helpful, I can then copy it into my book!

That's why I need feedback on this if you find it helpful! My email is <chastitywhiterose@gmail.com>. I get a lot of emails but if you ask me anything about Chess, it is my job to respond!
