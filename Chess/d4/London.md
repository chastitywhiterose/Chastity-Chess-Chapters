# Chastity’s Rules for the London System

Because Chess is a tree of moves with infinite branches, it is impossible to memorize every position and best move. My memory is not that great. So I have developed a list of rules that should make sense when certain moves are played by the opponent.

 The London System is a set of opening moves that build a strong defense but also allow some attacking chances. My best wins are achieved with the London System. When I lose it is usually due to an error I made in the middle or end of the game. The London is an opening for the white player who starts first. There is a mirrored version for black but it’s not as easy depending on how white is ahead by one move. All further information assumes you are playing white. I will probably write a separate guide for how this is best achieved.

Also, I assume you know Chess notation for the moves I am describing. For those who don’t, I will be making a video that goes over the same information to explain easily.

d4 is the first move always. This is the way to start. Nothing can stop white from playing anything they want for the very first move.

If black plays e5, just capture the pawn with your d4 pawn next turn. If black plays g5 capture that pawn with your bishop.

For all other cases, the next move is Bf4. Moving this bishop out early in the game is important so it doesn’t get trapped behind pawns.

e3 will be your third move almost all the time. If anything does manage to kill the pawn on d4 or bishop on f4, this pawn can capture it.

It is quite possible that black will play c5 on their first, second, or third move. If this happens, you don’t want to take it with your d4 pawn yet because this is an attempt for the queen to come out and put your king in check.

It’s best to avoid allowing your opponent to even put you in check. That’s why your fourth move should be knight to d2 because moving this knight here blocks any diagonal checks by the enemy bishop or queen. If black still tries a diagonal attack to pin the d2 knight, just advance the pawn on c2 to c3. This blocks the attack and will cause bishops to retreat and waste a move.

Alternatively, if you are playing a variant such as 3-check Chess, you probably will want to move your pawn to c3 even before the knight to d2 because you must avoid being put in check at any cost. In fact, c3 is totally okay before d2 even in standard Chess. I just tend to prefer waiting for the bishop to come out and then scare it away with that pawn after it attacks my knight or king. I find it funny but can't really say the move order matters other than for my sense of humor.
