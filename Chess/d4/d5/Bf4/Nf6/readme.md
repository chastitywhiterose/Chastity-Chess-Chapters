## The London System: Black plays Nf6

It's quite popular for black to respond with Knight to F6 with plans to bring it to E4 as part of an attack on white's weak F2 square. White is not in danger yet, but it could be once black's bishop or queen come out in the next few moves.

In any case, the common third move for white is moving the E2 pawn one space to E3 to protect the pawn and bishop already out there at the same time as allowing the light squared bishop on F1 to get out next.
