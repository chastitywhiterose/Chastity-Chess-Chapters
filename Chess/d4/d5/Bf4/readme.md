## The London System

This position is the start of the London System. White's bishop moves out to F4 immediately after both Queen pawns have moved two squares. The idea is that the bishop moves here so that it won't be blocked in when white moves their pawn to E3. F4 is a safe square for the bishop because it will take more than one move by black before it can be under a serious attack.
