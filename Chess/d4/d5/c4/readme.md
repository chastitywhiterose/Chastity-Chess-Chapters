# 1. d4 d5 2. c4
## The Queen's Gambit

People have heard of the Netflix show called The Queen's Gambit, but it was a common Chess opening long before the show existed.

White moves the c2 pawn to c4 to offer it as a sacrifice. This is a trap because although black gets to capture the pawn if they want to, white will likely move their King's pawn to e4 because the d5 pawn is no longer there to guard that space. Then both of white's bishops will be able to move freely.
