# 1. d4 d5

## Double Queen's Pawn Opening

When white plays d4 as their first move, there is a high chance that black will also do move their Queen's pawn two squares. This is the most common position Chastity has seen when playing her games.

Even if Chastity is the black player, she knows that she really wanted to play her Queen's pawn two squares because it's her favorite first move.
