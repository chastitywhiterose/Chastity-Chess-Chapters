# 1. d4
## Queen's Pawn Opening

d4 is the second most popular first move for white. The most popular is e4.
Chastity plays Queen's pawn to d4 as white with the hope that black will also move their Queen's pawn to d5. This could lead to the Queen's Gambit or the London System. In either case, Chastity would be in familiar territory with positions she has memorized.
