# 1. e4
## King's Pawn Opening

e4 was the favorite first move of Bobby Fischer who believed that it was objectively the best starting move.

Chastity does not disagree with Bobby on this, because the logic is hard to beat. After all, white will be able to move their Queen or Bishop diagonally on the next move.

e4 is an opening for people who hope to checkmate their opponent faster with a Scholar's mate or other more complicated traps.

But Chastity still prefers d4 as a starting move because the games are slower and more interesting. Chastity doesn't play for quick wins because she has patience and stamina like you wouldn't believe.
