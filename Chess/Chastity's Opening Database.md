# Chastity's Markdown Opening Database

This text file is a quick reference for me of the PGN notation of common positions.
This allows me to find out the name of the Gambit and also provide my own notes on what I think the best move is in that position.

Lines beginning with # are main headings and are usually the move list in PGN (Portable Game Notation).
In most cases, they were copied straight from the [lichess analysis board](https://lichess.org/analysis) to make sure I didn't make a mistake by typing out the notation myself.

Lines beginning with ## are the names of the opening or gambit and follow the PGN if there is a known name for it. This helps when Google Searching it for more research.

If you don't see the # signs then that means you are viewing this document in Markdown mode. Markdown is a super cool alternative to HTML that is supported by Github.
 See the [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) for more information about that.

After each of these, I write some notes on what I think of this position and what is probably the best move.

# 1. e4 e5 2. d4
## Center Game

Both sides have moved their King's pawn two squares. Now white plays d4 and allows black the chance to capture it. It seems silly but this is basically like a white version of the scandinavian. If black takes, white can capture back with the queen or follow with the Danish Gambit

# 1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3
## Danish Gambit

White has already sacrificed the d4 pawn and now offers another pawn for black to take. If black takes this, there are dangerous traps to follow.



# 1. d4 e5 2. dxe5 f6 3. exf6 Nxf6 4. Bg5 Bc5
## Englund Gambit: Soller Gambit

This position is extremely scary here. I almost lost to this in a Crazyhouse game I was playing.
See the analysis of that game here.

Of course the situation would have been different in standard Chess because I would not have just dropped pieces to win. In standard Chess this postion could possibly be a win for black if something is not done to stop the trap. For example, see the next position

# 1. d4 e5 2. dxe5 f6 3. exf6 Nxf6 4. Bg5 Bc5 5. Nf3 Ne4 6. Bxd8 Bxf2#

This position is checkmate against white. White may have captured black's queen, but it doesn't matter because white's king is in check and has no escape!
