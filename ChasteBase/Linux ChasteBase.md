# Linux Chess Database Project

## A sub project of ChasteBase

On Debian Linux, En Croissant stores its files here:

/home/chastity/.local/share/org.encroissant.app/db/

But for the purpose of collecting data from En Croissant and other databases from the internet, I have chosen the folder:

/home/chastity/chastebase/

The most popular free database is Caissabase. That's why it is my first choice for getting more game samples.

Lichess also allows everyone to download databases of all games played on the site sorted by month.

My Linux PC has a hard drive with more disk space, so I am downloading some of them. They contain millions more games so this could prove useful if my PC can actually store and process them.
