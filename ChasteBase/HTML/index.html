<h1>What is ChasteBase?</h1>

<p>ChasteBase is a new idea for a Chess Database invented by Chastity White Rose. It started because she invented a Tetris game called 

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1986120/Chaste_Tris/" target="_blank">Chaste Tris</a>

Chaste is the root word of Chastity. In the context of the Tetris game as well as ChasteBase, it means it is the pure form of something without extra, unnecessary, or corrupt things added. Just as Chastity wanted to make a Tetris game that is free from the greed of the Tetris company, she also saw that many Chess players are using ChessBase, which is the world's largest collection of software and databases that the top professional Chess players use when preparing for their over the board games.
</p>

<p>
ChasteBase is not a replacement for ChessBase, but it is a helpful resource that Chastity uses to remind herself of what she learned and also to teach students. There are no pictures on this page because it would increase loading times and designing pictures for infinite Chess positions. Instead, I recommend using the

<a href="https://lichess.org/analysis" target="_blank">Lichess Analysis Board</a>

to follow along with the Chess notation. For example, if you copy paste "1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e4 Nxe4 5.Bxc4 Bg4 6.Ne5 Bxd1 7.Bxf7#" into the PGN field of that page and click import, you will then be able to step through each move of a 13 move checkmate. Chess notation is well defined and supported by more Chess software than you can possibly imagine!

<p>Also, anyone serious about Chess will probably want to play Chess online on lichess.org anyway. You can play with

almost anytime by sending a challenge!

<h1>About this page</h1>

<p>This page was written by Chastity directly in HTML using only what she learned from the
 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
 at w3schools.
</p>

<p>
 Initially, Chastity considered writing it using Markdown but needs to learn a lot more about it first. HTML is older and the most compatible option for all devices and web browsers.

<h1>Chastity's Favorite Openings</h1>

<h1 id="queen_gambit">The Queen's Gambit</h1>
<h2>1. d4 d5 2. c4</h2>

<p>
The Queen's Gambit is one of the most popular openings in the world of Chess. It is what Chastity plays almost all the time. The idea is very simple. White sacrifices a pawn on c4 to buy time to get the bishop and knight out. This small sacrifice can lead to an advantage for white if black falls for the trap.

<h1 id="london">The London System</h1>
<h2>1. d4 d5 2. Bf4</h2>

<p>
In contrast to the Queen's Gambit, the London System is a safe way to play Chess while trying not to lose pieces.
