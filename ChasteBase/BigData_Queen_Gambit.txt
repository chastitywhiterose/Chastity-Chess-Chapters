A script to extract all black wins with the Queen's Gambit Opening
However, these commands should probably not be run as a batch script and should instead be copy pasted
Otherwise, we run the risk of crashing the computer and not knowing where the progress was.
Therefore, this is a plain text file only and cannot be executed.

It takes a long time to process millions of Chess games, even though pgn-extract is very fast!

This section is for extracting black wins.

pgn-extract ../BigData/caissabase.pgn -Tr0-1 -x../BigData/queengambit.txt -oblack_queengambit_caissabase.pgn --checkmate

pgn-extract ../BigData/MillionBase.pgn -Tr0-1 -x../BigData/queengambit.txt -oblack_queengambit_MillionBase.pgn --checkmate

pgn-extract "../BigData/Ajedrez Data - Correspondence.pgn" "../BigData/Ajedrez Data - OTB.pgn" -Tr0-1 -x../BigData/queengambit.txt -oblack_queengambit_Ajedrez.pgn --checkmate

pgn-extract ../BigData/MasterGames.pgn -Tr0-1 -x../BigData/queengambit.txt -oblack_queengambit_MasterGames.pgn --checkmate


After we have extracted all of the Queen's Gambit wins from all of my BigData sources (free databases plus MasterGames from HIARCS), we will need to combine them all back into one file.

pgn-extract -oblack_queengambit_All.pgn black_queengambit_caissabase.pgn black_queengambit_MillionBase.pgn black_queengambit_Ajedrez.pgn black_queengambit_MasterGames.pgn

The next thing is to combine all the databases relating to the Queen's Gambit that I have purchased through ChessBase.
These are special because I purchased them and then converted them to PGN files to be used outside of ChessBase

pgn-extract "../BigData/Queens Gambit Accepted Powerbase 2019.pgn" "../BigData/Queens Gambit Declined Powerbase 2024.pgn" "../BigData/The Slav and Semislav Powerbase 2021.pgn" -Tr0-1 -x../BigData/queengambit.txt -oblack_queengambit_ChessBase.pgn --checkmate

Final Section

Combining all of the databases so far into their final collections for black and white separately
